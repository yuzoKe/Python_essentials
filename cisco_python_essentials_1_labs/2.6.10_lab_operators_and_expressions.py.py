2.6.10 LAB - Operators and expressions

Scenario
Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the following expression:

    1
  ---------
        1
  x + -------
          1
      x + -----
            1
        x + -
            x

The result should be assigned to y. Be careful â€’ watch the operators and keep their priorities in mind. 
Don't hesitate to use as many parentheses as you need.
You can use additional variables to shorten the expression (but it's not necessary). Test your code carefully.

Sample Input1 : 1
Expected output1: y = 0.6000000000000001

x = float(input("Enter value for x: "))

y = 1 / (x + 1 / (x + 1 / (x + 1 / x)))
